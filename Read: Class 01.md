:red_square: All growth comes with some degree of pain, as it pulls you out of your comfort zone. 
The greater the growth, the greater the pain. But pain in the service of growth is a good thing, as long as that pain is what’s necessary to achieve the growth that you’re aiming for. And even better than that, this pain is only temporary. It’s what will launch you forward into the next phase of your life.

Do not confuse this with suffering.

Suffering is pain without purpose. Pain with no higher goal. Pain with no dreams, no ambition, no aspiration.

:red_square: Big O notation is used in Computer Science to describe the performance or complexity of an algorithm. Big O specifically describes the worst-case scenario, and can be used to describe the execution time required or the space used (e.g. in memory or on disk) by an algorithm.
A grasp of Big O is an important tool when dealing with algorithms that need to operate at scale, allowing you to make the correct choices and acknowledge trade-offs when working with different data sets.

:red_square: when dealing with Python names and values:
1-Assignment never copies data.
2. Python is neither "Call By value" nor "Call By Reference", it's "Call by Assignment"! 
3. There is no way in python where a name can refer to another name. A name can only refer to values.
